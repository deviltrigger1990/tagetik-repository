# Tagetik-Repository

The code published in the Tagetik-Repository repository contains the Java implementation of the three exercises provided by Tagetik.

## Exercises 1 and 2

Exercises 1 and 2 can be tested using the `ExerciseTest1` and `ExerciseTest2` classes located in the `/src/main/test` folder within the Maven modules `TagetikFirstProject` and `TagetikSecondProject`. The business logic for Exercise 1 is encapsulated in the documented interface `CategoryAllDescendantsRetriever`, and for Exercise 2 in the documented interface `CategoryTotalAmountCalculator`.

## Exercise 3

Exercise 3 exposes REST services running in a Spring Boot application. To launch the Spring Boot server, navigate to the `TagetikThirdProject` folder and start the Spring Boot server with the Maven command `mvn spring-boot`.

For this project, you can also run tests found in the `Exercise3Test` class located in the `/src/main/test` folder of the `TagetikThirdProject`.
